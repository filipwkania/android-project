# Android project

The main idea of this student project is to revive old-school games so we can enjoy them again â€“ in a new way. Additional thing is that games will be written in Java and playable on mobile devices (running Android OS) so practically everyone who owns a smartphone will have easy and free access to them.

As a first game to be revived I chose Arkanoid. Probably everyone has played it or at least saw it once. The point of the game was to bounce the ball with a metal bar so it hits and destroys bricks on the screen. When the last brick was destroyed player advanced to the next level.

The point of Crystal defender is the opposite. The player will have to fill all available space with bricks and then advance to next difficulty level. Points are assigned for each ball that will be stopped by brick and thus will not hit the base. An additional bonus is given to a player for e.g. filling a column with 5 bricks, for a whole row of bricks of the same color and for other things.
